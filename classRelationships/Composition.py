"""
What if the relationship is so strong, that the part cannot exists without the whole,
This is the world of composition which is a strong form of association, where the
whole owns the lifecycle of the part.

Consider order and lineitems , lineitems can't exist without the order, if order
destroys lineitems also goes with it.

When to use composition:
 - is the part meaningless without whole
 - should the whole controls the lifecycle of the part
 - are the parts exclusive to one whole
 - do you want to model strong containment

It is represented with a diamond on the whole
